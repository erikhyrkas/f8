Simple 8-bit Float Implementation

This code is part of my microml project, which I will release when it is finished. I simply wanted to release what
I thought would be useful on its own while I continue my work on microml.

Open the code to read all about how floating point numbers work, especially 8-bit floating point numbers.

# Who is Erik Hyrkas
I'm Erik Hyrkas. I'm a generalist. I code, but I also write science fiction and fantasy books, create video games, 
and thrive on creating and learning new things.

## And why would use code written by me?
I have done everything from application development to information security to cloud architecture to data engineering. 
I've built or rebuilt different technologies that exist to either make them better or to learn from them. Some of them
were created as paid work when these technologies were still sparkling and new and there was no clear dominate market
leader. Other technologies were well established, but I wanted a deeper understanding. I have built things like 
a search engine, a recommendation engine, a proxy server, a word processor with spell checker and some fun NLP tech, a 
web server, a web browser, a voice over internet protocol and application, a sql database, a distributed queue, a 
distributed cache, a dependency injection framework, an ORM framework, programing languages, scripting languages, 
game engines, games, database drivers, VNC client and server, a chess engine, and other insanely tedious and difficult 
to build technologies, just for the sake of understanding them. What's more I love learning new languages. I started 
with BASIC in 1983, then x86 macro assembler in 1987, and have branched out to pretty much everything. There are many languages I 
haven't worked with and plenty that I haven't put in enough hours to be an expert with, but I've seen some stuff.

You've never heard of me, probably because nothing I've made was ever important enough or unique enough to be useful, 
or maybe it was because I was simply paid to build it and there is no public credit for such things, but maybe 
something that I'm learning about can help you.
